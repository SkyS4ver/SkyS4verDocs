# Step 1 : Choose the API to be used to retrieve the data

After several research, we found multiple API such as :
- Amadeus
- Kiwi.com API
- Skyscanner API
- Aviationstack
- FlightLabs API

We choose <kbd>[Amadeus](https://developers.amadeus.com/)</kbd> for multiple reasons :
- It provides two different environments, one for testing and one for production.
- You can use their API key for free or by paying if you need more features or enhanced data.
- It was real fast and easy to create/use the API key to test the API.
