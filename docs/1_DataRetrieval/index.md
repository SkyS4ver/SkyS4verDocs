# Data Retrieval

Our aim in this project is to use the AWS Cloud as much as possible to increase our skills on it.
We will therefore be using several services in this phase:
- [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/iam/) ;
- [Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/s3/) ;
- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/lambda/)

The aim of this stage is to retrieve large quantities of data from a public API on flight searches.\
We will then store this data in an S3 bucket using prefixes.\
This data will be used for the next stage, in which we will structure our data as best we can using other AWS services.
