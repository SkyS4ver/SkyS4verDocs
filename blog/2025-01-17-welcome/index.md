## ✈️ <strong>The birth of SkySaver</strong> ✈️

<!-- truncate -->

Hi everyone !

First post and surely not the last.\
**[Théo](https://github.com/shannorr)** and **[I](https://github.com/nicolasjp)** started this project because we wanted to improve our skills on AWS.
:::info
We are 2 ***AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate*** and we wanted to test us and improve our skills after this great achievement !
:::

For that, we think a lot about what kind of project we can do and after several meetings, we found something... What do you think about finding your plane tickets to a dream destination at the best price ?\
That's all about **SkySaver**, allowing the most people to search the best prices for their plane tickets !

See you on the next article 👋
